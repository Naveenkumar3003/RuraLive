INTRODUCTION
Smart Bus Tracking System for Rural Areas

The Smart Bus Tracking System is a digital solution designed to improve transportation in rural regions where bus timings are unpredictable and information is limited. This project provides real-time bus location, estimated arrival time, and SMS alerts for passengers without smartphones. The goal is to reduce waiting time, improve safety, and make rural commuting more reliable and efficient.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROBLEM STATEMENT
•  Rural passengers do not know the exact bus arrival time.
•  Long waiting hours at bus stops cause inconvenience and safety issues.
•  Students often miss classes due to unpredictable bus schedules.
•  Drivers have no proper way to inform passengers about delays or route changes.
•  Administrators struggle to monitor buses in real time.
•  Lack of technology creates miscommunication between passengers, drivers, and operators.
•  Existing solutions require high-speed internet, which rural areas lack.
•  There is no unified system that provides real-time updates for everyone.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposed Solutions
•  Real-Time Bus Tracking
Show live GPS location of buses on the map.
•  Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA)
Predict accurate arrival times for each bus stop.
•  SMS Alerts for Rural Users
Send arrival updates, delays, and emergency notifications to non-smartphone users.
•  Driver Update System
Allow drivers to report delays, breakdowns, and route changes instantly.
•  Admin Monitoring Dashboard
Track all buses, check routes, manage schedules, and view analytics.
